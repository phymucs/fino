    - transient heat
    - shake
    - thermo-mechanical
    - parametric (cantilever)
    - multimaterial (two-cubes)
    - multifreedom (radial, conic)
    - linearization
    - axisymmmetric (elephant)

 * manual
 * rewrite DEBUG
 * rewrite --version output: compact, standard & extended
 * unify problem types
 * compute heat fluxes
 * put mat2sng in a different code
 * DMplex
 * parallelization
 * find an explicit solution for the 3x3 matrix in the routine that computes the barycentric coordinates -> cramer?
 * see if some for loops can be replaced by matrix-matrix products
