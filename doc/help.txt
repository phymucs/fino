-d or --debug

    Start in debug mode

--node-debug

    Ignore standard input, avoid debug mode

-l or --list

    List defined symbols and exit

-h or --help

    Display this help and exit

-i or --info

    Display detailed code information and exit

-v or --version

    Display version information and exit

--mumps

    use the MUMPS direct solver (if available)

--petsc <option[=argument]>

    Pass -option argument directly to PETSc/SLEPc, e.g.

        $ fino tensile-test.fin --petsc ksp_view

    The option --petsc is provided to avoid clashes with PETScâ€™
    non-POSIX arguments. Note that options are passed directly to
    PETSc/SLEPc if they do not clash with Fino/wasora. The same command
    as above could have been called as

        $ fino tensile-test.fin -ksp_view

Input file instructions are read from standard input if a dash - is
passed as input-file.

Fino accepts optional extra arguments which are then verbatimly replaced
in the input file as $1, $2, and so on. So for example if an input file
has a line like this

    MESH_FILE $1.msh
    [...]

Then two different meshes called one.msh and two.msh can successively be
used in two runs with the same input file by calling Fino as

    fino input.fin one
    fino input.fin two
