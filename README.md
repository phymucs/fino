![Fino: a free finite-element solver](doc/fino.svg){.img-fluid}\ 


[Fino](https://www.seamplex.com/fino) is a free and open source tool that uses the finite-element method to solve

 * steady-state thermo-mechanical problems, or
 * steady or transient heat conduction problems, or
 * modal analysis problems.

It is particularly designed to handle complex dependence of material properties (i.e. temperature-dependent properties). It can also perform parametric or optimization runs. The domain over which the problem is solved should be a grid generated by [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/). The material properties and boundary conditions may involve arbitrary dependence of space associated to physical entities defined in the mesh. 

Fino follows, amongst [others](https://www.seamplex.com/principles.html), the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). Fino is a [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) aimed at advanced users. For an easy-to-use web-based front-end with Fino running in the cloud, see [CAEplex](https://www.caeplex.com):

# Quick start

:::

Open a terminal in a GNU/Linux box (may be a VirtualBox box) and install the following tools and libraries:

~~~
sudo apt-get install m4 make autoconf automake gcc g++ git findutils
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev libsundials-serial-dev libreadline-dev petsc-dev slepc-dev
~~~

If your distribution does not have a bundled version of [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) or [SLEPc](http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/), then you might need to compile them yourself (SLEPc is optional for Fino). Ask for help in the [mailing list](https://www.seamplex.com/lists.html).

Clone the Fino repository, bootstrap (might take a while as it has to clone and bootstrap [wasora](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/) first), configure, compile, check and install:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/seamplex/fino.git
cd fino
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
~~~

If these instructions are non-sense to you, go directly to the [mailing list](https://www.seamplex.com/lists.html).

Note that you also need to have a working and reasonably-recent version of Gmsh in order to use Fino. See <http://gmsh.info> for further information.

# Features

Fino uses a main input file (see below for [examples](#examples)), that in turn instructs Fino to read one or more mesh files in [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) format. Fino works on top of the [wasora framework](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora) so it shares its [design basis](https://www.seamplex.com/docs/SP-FI-17-BM-5460-A.pdf) and inherits all of its features:


  * evaluation of [algebraic expressions](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-002-expressions.html)
  * [one](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-007-functions.html) and [multi-dimensional](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-010-2dfunctions.html) function interpolation
  * [scalar](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-001-peano.html), [vector](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-006-fibonacci.html) and matrix operations
  * numerical [integration](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-008-integrals.html), [differentiation](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-017-double-pendulum.html) and [root finding](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-020-gsl.html) of functions
  * possibility to solve [iterative](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-030-buffon.html) and/or [time-dependent](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-003-lag.html) problems
  * adaptive [integration of systems of differential-algebraic equations](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-018-waterwheel.html)
  * I/O from files and shared-memory objects (with optional synchronization using semaphores)
  * execution of [arbitrary code](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-015-primes) provided as shared object files
  * [parametric runs using quasi-random sequence numbers](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-025-mathace.html) to efficiently sweep a sub-space of parameter space 
  * solution of systems of non-linear algebraic equations
  * non-linear fit of scattered data to [one](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-020-gsl.html) or [multidimensional](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-028-mass.html) functions
  * [non-linear multidimensional optimization](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/realbook/real-020-gsl.html)
  * management of unstructured grids

Output is 100% defined in the input file. If no explicit output instruction is provided, Fino remains silent (as required by the [UNIX rule of silence](http://www.linfo.org/rule_of_silence.html)). Besides terminal and plain-text files (e.g. user-defined results in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)), post-processing files in [VTK](http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~slombey/asci/vtk/vtk_formats.simple.html) o [MSH](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#File-formats) formats can be generated.

# Examples

See the directory `examples` for further cases.


## Tensile test 

Let us consider the example input file [`examples/tensile-test.fin`](examples/tensile-test.fin):

~~~fino
MESH FILE_PATH tensile-test.msh  DIMENSIONS 3 # mesh file in Gmsh format

FINO_SOLVER PROGRESS_ASCII    # show a feedback in the terminal while solving

# uniform properties
E = 200e3   # [ MPa ] Young modulus ~ 200 GPa
nu = 0.3    # Poisson ratio

# boundary conditions ("left" and "right" come from the names in the mesh)
PHYSICAL_ENTITY left  BC fixed
PHYSICAL_ENTITY right BC tx=0.002*E*(10/13)  # traction

# other possible conditions:
# PHYSICAL_ENTITY right BC p=0.002*E*(10/13)   # pressure
# PHYSICAL_ENTITY right BC u=0.3               # displacement
# PHYSICAL_ENTITY right BC Mx=1                # moment

# print some data
PRINT TEXT "elements                    =" %g elements
PRINT TEXT "nodes                       =" %g nodes

FINO_STEP

# results
MESH_POST FILE_PATH tensile-test.vtk sigma sigma1 sigma2 sigma3 VECTOR u v w

# displ_max gets the norm of the maximum displacement
PRINT TEXT "maximum_displacement    [mm]  =" displ_max
# u(x,y,z) (and v(x,y,z) and z(x,y,y) are the individual displacements
PRINT TEXT "horizontal_displacement [mm]  =" u(80,0,0)
# sigma(x,y,z) is the von mises stress
PRINT TEXT "stress_at_the_origin    [MPa] =" sigma(0,0,0)
# the reaction force is stored at "physical entity name underscore RF"
PRINT TEXT "reaction_at_fixed_end   [N]   =" left_RF

PRINT FILE_PATH tensile-sigma.dat %.0f sigma(0,0,0)
~~~

If we ran this example from a terminal, we would get something like this:

~~~bash
$ fino tensile-test.fin 
elements                    =   4831
nodes                       =   9283
....................................................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================================================================================================
maximum_displacement    [mm]  = 0.302147
horizontal_displacement [mm]  = 0.301784
stress_at_the_origin    [MPa] = 399.999
reaction_at_fixed_end   [N]   = -40082.3        63.6526 -68.9191$ 
~~~

The three lines with the dots, dashes and double dashes are ASCII progress bars for the assembly of the stiffness matrix, the solution of the linear system and the computation of stresses, respectively. We can process the `VTK` output file with the free tool [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/):

## Conic valve

Can your solver constrain your model faces to algebraically-defined surfaces such as cones? Ours can (and it is open source):
