Fino: FINite element methOd
===========================

Fino is a free tool to solve partial differential equations using the finite element method. It is particularly designed to handle linear elastic problems, natural frequency analysis and heat conduction but arbirtary equations may be included. The domain over which the PDE is solved (which can be either one, two or three-dimensional) should be a mesh generated by [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/). The material properties (i.e. the coefficientes of the PDE) may involve arbitrary dependence of space associated to volumetric physical entities defined in the mesh. Dirichlet, Neumann and/or Robin boundary conditions can be given as algebraic functions of space and are also associated to surface physical entities.


Quick download, compile & check
-------------------------------

If you are impatient to run fino (or have failed to follow the instructions in [INSTALL](INSTALL.md)), open a terminal in any GNU/Linux box (may be a VirtualBox box) and execute these commands (you can copy & paste them):

```
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install m4 autoconf gcc gfortran mercurial make texinfo wget
mkdir libs
cd libs
wget -c http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/petsc-lite-3.7.3.tar.gz
tar xvzf petsc-lite-3.7.3.tar.gz 
cd petsc-3.7.3/
export PETSC_DIR=$PWD
./configure --download-fblaslapack --with-mpi=0 --with-debugging=0
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-opt
make
make test
cd ..
wget -c http://slepc.upv.es/download/download.php?filename=slepc-3.7.2.tar.gz
mv download.php\?filename=slepc-3.7.2.tar.gz slepc-3.7.2.tar.gz
tar xvzf slepc-3.7.2.tar.gz
cd slepc-3.7.2/
export SLEPC_DIR=$PWD
./configure
make
make test
cd $HOME
mkdir wasora-suite
cd wasora-suite
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wasora/wasora
cd wasora
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-download-gsl
make
make check
cd ..
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wasora/fino
cd fino
./autogen.sh
./configure
make SHELL=/bin/bash
make SHELL=/bin/bash check
cd $HOME
mkdir bin
ln -s wasora-suite/fino/fino bin/fino
cat << EOF >> .bashrc
# added by fino
export PATH=\$HOME/bin:\$PATH
export PETSC_ARCH=$PETSC_ARCH
export PETSC_DIR=$PETSC_DIR
export SLEPC_DIR=$SLEPC_DIR
EOF
```

If the above is just non-sense to you or you encounter problems with the commands (probably because you are lacking some package), either:

 a. See the detailed explanation in [INSTALL](INSTALL.md)  
 b. Ask for help in the mailing list at <wasora@seamplex.com>


Staying up to date
------------------

To keep fino up to date both wasora and Fino have to be updated periodically:

```
cd $HOME/wasora-suite/wasora
hg pull
hg update
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
cd ../fino
hg pull
hg update
./autogen.sh
./configure
make SHELL=/bin/bash
make SHELL=/bin/bash check
cd $HOME
```
