Current:
 * use PETSc’s TS for transient heat conduction

0.7 (April 16, 2020): improved stresses, basic paralellization and some documentation

 * conditional BCs
 * improved support for 2D (plane stress/strain) problems
 * interpolate strains using derivatives of the shape functions and not the shape functions themselves
 * attempt to estimate uncertainties in computation of stresses
 * interface to direct solver MUMPS
 * basic parallelization using MPI
 * “rough” mode: do not always smooth strains and stresses, per-material or never
 * use element-wise objects for caching shape function evaluation
 * computations of stresses at Gauss points extrapolated to nodes
 * reactions using the original stiffness matrix (before setting Dirichlet BCs)
 * internal strain_energy variable
 * use Lamé coefficients for computing stresses
 * refactored computation of modal quantities
 * added total heat BC
 * rewritten moment BCs
 * symmetry and radial BCs
 * implicit BCs using derivatives computed by GSL




0.6 (March 11, 2019): reasonably usable version
